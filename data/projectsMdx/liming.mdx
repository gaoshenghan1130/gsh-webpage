# Overview

This project involves designing and building a robot for the Liming Cup competition, a robotics contest for students at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The robot was designed to complete multiple tasks within a limited time, demonstrating both mechanical design and control systems engineering.

I served as the team leader of a four-member group, responsible for designing and building the robot. Our team won 3rd place overall and received the Best Design Award.

# What We Did

We built a robot capable of performing several tasks within tight time constraints. The project involved both hardware design and embedded programming.

## Hardware Design

We abandoned general-purpose solutions in favor of a custom-built system tailored specifically to the competition's requirements.

### Robot Arm

The robot arm incorporates several lever mechanisms to achieve precise motion and object manipulation — a structure very different from standard multi-joint or lift-style designs.

Two main levers control the arm's motion. The upper lever performs precise lifting of objects, while the lower lever coordinates forward and backward movement aligned with the front two wheels.

A motor between the upper lever and the crawler mechanism allows the entire gripper assembly to rotate to different orientations.

This design proved highly effective during the competition:

### Wheels

The robot uses a three-wheel configuration: two driven wheels and one caster wheel. This layout allows smooth and precise movement, especially during turns, while maintaining a wide chassis for stability and for pushing objects when needed.

### Structure

The robot’s chassis was designed to be robust and stable. The frame was laser-cut from **acrylic sheets (PMMA)**, providing a lightweight yet strong structure.

## Software

The software component involved embedded programming and real-time control of the robot's movement and task behaviors. One of the main challenges was coordinating all actions to meet the strict time limits, demanding close integration of hardware and software.
