## Overview

**Time Wielder: Odyssey** is a fast-paced roguelike adventure that explores the boundaries of **time manipulation**.  
Players step into the shoes of **Ken**, a man haunted by loss and driven by obsession — searching across galaxies for a way to **reverse time** and save his family.

Set in the year **312 of the Sigma Galactic Calendar**, the game blends intense combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving — all centered on the **control of time** itself.

## Game Concept

After losing his family in a riot, Ken spends ten years researching time, failing again and again.  
Just as he’s about to give up, he receives a mysterious message:

> “Someone on planet _Crystal_ possesses the power to reverse time.”

Determined, Ken — the _Time Wielder_ — joins a galactic campaign to conquer _Crystal_.  
Will he uncover the truth of time reversal… or be consumed by it?
