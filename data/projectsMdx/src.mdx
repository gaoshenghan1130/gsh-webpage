# About the team

## What is Robocup SSL? What is SRC?

Robocup SSL (Small Size League) is a competition in the Robocup initiative, which aims to promote robotics and AI research through competitive events. In this league, teams of small robots compete in soccer matches, showcasing their capabilities in perception, decision-making, and teamwork. The Shanghai Jiao Tong University School Robocup SSL team focuses on developing advanced algorithms and software solutions to enhance robot performance on the field.

The **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University RoboCup SSL (Small Size League)](https://sjtu-src.github.io/Wiki/)** team — also known as **SRC** — is part of the **Student Innovation Center**, alongside RoboMaster and VEX teams.

Founded in 2017 and guided by _Coach Chuntao Leng_, SRC focuses on the **RoboCup Small Size League**, where teams of autonomous robots play high-speed soccer matches. The competition challenges teams in areas such as **real-time control**, **computer vision**, **multi-agent coordination**, and **embedded systems**.

## Team Structure

The SRC team consists of four collaborating divisions — **Software**, **Electronics**, **Hardware**, and **Operations** — jointly responsible for robot design, development, and competition performance.

## Software Group

The _Software Group_ acts as the **central nervous system** of the team.  
It focuses on AI decision-making, path planning, motion control, and real-time communication. Members implement algorithms that enable robots to perceive, strategize, and cooperate on the field.

**Core Areas:**

- C++, Python, and Lua programming
- Path planning and motion control algorithms
- Multi-robot cooperation and decision-making AI
- Development in large-scale, multi-module codebases

## Electronics & Hardware

The _Electronics_ and _Hardware_ groups design the **mechanical and electrical foundation** of the robots — from PCBs and motor control to 3D modeling and structural optimization.

**Core Areas:**

- Altium Designer & PCB layout
- BLDC motor control, PID tuning
- SolidWorks modeling and mechanical design
- Assembly, debugging, and testing

## Operations

The _Operations Group_ handles all logistical and promotional aspects — from media design and event planning to competition travel and finances.

# My Contributions

As a **software developer** and **software team leader** in the SRC team, I contributed to several key modules that improved communication efficiency, tactical decision-making, and modularity in the system architecture.

Details for these projects can also be found on the side bar.

**[RRCC — Real-time RoboCup Communication Protocol](/projects/rrcc)**

**[Optimized Role Matching System](/projects/rolematch)**

**[Python C++ UDP Server](/projects/udpServer)**

Some other project contributions (CUDA optimization, Lua reconstruction to Python, PyBind and refactored decorated FSM, etc.) have not been documented in this webpage yet, you may find details of them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gaoshenghan1130).

## Competition Experience with SRC

The most important and impactful competition of the team with me was **RoboCup 2025**, where I acted as the software team leader.

The competition is held in Beijing, China, and it gathered top teams from around the Country including, SJTU, Zhejiang University, Ningbo Engineering University, Wuhan University, and more.
