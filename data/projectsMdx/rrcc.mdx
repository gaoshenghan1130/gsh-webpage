name: RRCC Protocol for Python-C++ Communication
intro: RRCC Protocol for UDP-based communication between Python and C++ applications using Qt and Protobuf.
desc: This project involves the development of a RRCC protocol that facilitates communication between Python and C++ applications. It leverages Qt's event-driven architecture for efficient asynchronous I/O operations in C++ and utilizes Python's socket library and asyncio for seamless UDP communication. The server supports multiple concurrent connections, ensuring low latency and high throughput for data transmission. Additionally, it implements a custom protocol using protobuf to ensure reliable data transfer even when one side is temporarily unresponsive. This RRCC protocol is ideal for applications requiring fast and reliable communication between Python and C++ components, enabling continuous debugging and development without the need to restart the Python application.
